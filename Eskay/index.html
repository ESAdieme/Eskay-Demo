          <h3> Construction Facilities Services</h3>
          <p>Eskay Facilities Limited offers a bespoke construction Facilities service. This service is tailored to meet the specific requirements of each of our clients and their sites.
            Construction and building sites are fast becoming the new ‘free-for-all’ areas for criminals and thieves to operate. It is a massive problem for organizations small or large to have heavy equipment like diggers, etc be stolen or vandalized by undesirables, and also the increased theft of copper wires and leads. It is very expensive for you and for your insurers, and no end to the rise in premiums that follow the ‘domino’ effect of such events happening such as theft or vandalism.
            
            We can provide you with affordable Facilities guards and mobile patrols which can help your business fight criminal activity. Our Facilities guards can act as a highly-effective visual deterrent whilst our mobile Facilities patrol units can strategically drive by at intervals for your construction site Facilities.</p>

          <h3> Mobile Facilities Patrol Services </h3>
          <p>Eskay Facilities has high-visibility patrol vehicles from which we offer property protection and a visual deterrent against intruders for our clients.

            Uniformed guards operate patrols to clients’ premises 24 hours a day from a single visit to multiple visits depending on the perceived risk. As with all of our services, the level of service is negotiated in partnership with the client.
            
            Site visits can be verified by the use of an electronic recording tag system. We will listen to your needs; give appropriate advice where required and act as ongoing partners with you to protect people, property, and assets.</p>

          <h3> Reception/Concierge Duties </h3>
          <p>Eskay Facilities Management provides dedicated staff to complement your business profile by way of a Concierge service at the forefront of your business. They will be the first person any clients will see as a representative of your company. They will be responsible for access control of personnel and goods entering your premises and depending on your instructions, will deter any unwanted salesmen/couriers, etc. from disturbing you and your staff while at work.

            The Concierge is an asset to any business, that is selected and recruited for their inter-personnel, communication, personal presentation, and computer skills.</p>
